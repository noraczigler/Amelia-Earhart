                <h2>About Amelia</h2>
                <p>Amelia Mary Earhart (born July 24, 1897; disappeared July 2, 
                    1937; declared dead January 5, 1939) was an American aviation pioneer and 
                    writer. Earhart was the first female aviator to fly solo across the Atlantic Ocean. She set many other records, was one of the first aviators 
                    to promote commercial air travel, wrote best-selling books about her flying experiences, 
                    and was instrumental in the formation of The Ninety-Nines, an organization for female pilots</p>
                    <p>Born and raised in Atchison, Kansas, and later in Des Moines, Iowa, Earhart developed a passion 
                        for adventure at a young age, steadily gaining flying experience from her twenties. In 1928, 
                        Earhart became the first female passenger to cross the Atlantic by airplane 
                        (accompanying pilot Wilmer Stultz), for which she achieved celebrity status. In 1932, 
                        piloting a Lockheed Vega 5B, Earhart made a nonstop solo transatlantic flight, becoming 
                        the first woman to achieve such a feat. She received the United States Distinguished Flying 
                        Cross for this accomplishment.In 1935, Earhart became a visiting faculty member at Purdue 
                        University as an advisor to aeronautical engineering and a career counselor to female students.
                         She was also a member of the National Woman's Party and an early supporter of the Equal Rights
                          Amendment. Known as one of the most inspirational American figures in aviation from the 
                          late 1920s throughout the 1930s, Earhart's legacy is often compared to the early aeronautical
                           career of pioneer aviator Charles Lindbergh, as well as to figures like First Lady 
                           Eleanor Roosevelt 
                        for their close friendship and lasting impact on the issue of women's causes from that period.</p>
                        <p>During an attempt at becoming the first woman to complete a circumnavigational flight of the 
                            globe in 1937 in a Purdue-funded Lockheed Model 10-E Electra, Earhart and navigator Fred Noonan 
                            disappeared over the central Pacific Ocean near Howland Island. The two were last seen in Lae, 
                            New Guinea, on July 2, 1937, on the last land stop before Howland Island and one of their final 
                            legs of the flight. She presumably died in the Pacific during the circumnavigation, just three weeks 
                            prior to her fortieth birthday. Nearly one year and six months after she and Noonan disappeared,
                             Earhart was officially declared dead. Investigations and 
                            significant public interest in their disappearance still continue over 80 years later.</p>
